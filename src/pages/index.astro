	<h1>Mike's Reading List ðŸ“š</h1>

	<header>
		<p>
			This is my attempt to capture the books that I have read/will read soon. It's currently based
			soley on my library borrowing history and my Kindle purchases as recorded by Amazon. In the
			future I will attempt to backfill books from before I owned a kindle.
		</p>

		<p>
			As I go forward (and as I have time to backfill) I may also add my thoughts on each book as
			well. Right now that's a bit of a daunting task since there are quite a few.
		</p>

		<aside>
			The outbound links provided to Bookshop and Amazon are searches for that book's title and
			author, they may not work 100% of the time. I also have no affiliate link or otherwise
			identifying mechanism &mdash; they are provided as a convenience and I will not profit from
			this at all.
