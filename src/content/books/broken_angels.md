The second book in the Takeshi Kovacs series, this one is more about planetary conflict and the interaction of governments with corporations. I did enjoy learning more about the Martians and how humanity was/is affected by discovering their technology - and boy! There are some _big_ discoveries in this one. (also more sex scenes to skip past - ugh)
