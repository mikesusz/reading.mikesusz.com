Just started this and I have to admit, I _think_ I've read this one before? In paperback, soon after it was released (2002). At the time I didn't know it was (going to be?) a trilogy, so I'm reading it again and frankly I don't recall a lot about it, but I plan to continue on to read the next two books as well.
