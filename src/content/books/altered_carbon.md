I have to admit, I _think_ I've read this one before? In paperback, soon after it was released (2002). At the time I didn't know it was (going to be?) a trilogy, so I read it again with the intent to continue on to books two and three.

As dystopian noir science fiction goes, this series might be at the extent of the _noir_ that I'm comfortable with. It's a bit too 'gritty' and I really don't ever appreciate sex scenes, especially ones that are so explicity described (I skipped over a few). The premise is interesting enough that I will continue on the next two books.
