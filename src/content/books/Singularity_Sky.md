Singularity Sky is the first book in a trilogy that is quite different from stuff I've read before (and very different from what I've read lately). Initially it struck me as inane, and I wasn't sure that I could continue with it. But it settled down into a comprehensible story and I really enjoyed it. I immediately got the second book in the series.
