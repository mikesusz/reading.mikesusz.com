This story is an interesting premise; the world is a frozen tundra, and there are two distinct classes of people - those who live out in the cold, and those who live inside of an enormous domed city called Snowglobe. The outsiders want to find a way inside, and the insiders sustain themselves by essentially living reality-tv style lives to entertain those on the outside.

As the book went on, angles were developed that I wasn't expecting, which kept it interesting. The only confusing thing for me is an element of magic... or unexplained technical ability, that I wasn't expecting.
