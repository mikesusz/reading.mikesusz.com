A sequel to Moon of the Crusted Snow, which I honestly didn't think would have a sequel? But it was recommended to me by some algorithm and I'm glad.

It picks up on where the first book left off, plus ten years. As post-apocalypses go, that usually means quite a difference. It's enough time to represent an abandonment of hope to 'return to the old world' but also to spark some wonder about 'what happened to everyone else?'

It answers those questions. The end was a mix of happiness and sadness, hope and forlorn. As all good post-apoc is, I suppose. Will there be a third book? the door does seem to be open.
