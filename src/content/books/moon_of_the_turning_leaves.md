Started this one recently (a hold came up and I had to take a break from a different book to get this one read before my loan expired). A sequel to Moon of the Crusted Snow, which I honestly didn't think would have a sequel? But it was recommended to me by some algorithm and I'm glad.

It picks up on where the first book left off, plus ten years. As post-apocalypses go, that usually means quite a difference. It's enough time to represent an abandonment of hope to 'return to the old world' but also to spark some wonder about 'what happened to everyone else?'

I'm about 1/3 of the way through it, and I'll update again when I finish it.
