Finished this one pretty quickly. It's an interesting new universe that he's created here. There's a lot of exposition explaining what the characters in the book do, because it's something we can't relate to. That can get a bit weary. But it doesn't hit you with an 'as you know bob' download up front.

There's also a family at the core of the story, and (several) mysteries. So there's something deeper than the world and the tech. The book wraps up a primary conflict for this installment, and sets up to address another in the next.

I might not zoom right to the next book; this one was written in 2014, the next was released in 2022. Not sure how long I want to wait on the next cliffhanger before the third book is completed.
