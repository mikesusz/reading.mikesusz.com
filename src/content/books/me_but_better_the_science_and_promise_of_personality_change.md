I heard the author on a podcast and was super interested to read it. I'm about 1/4 of the way through (a hold came up on another fiction book I needed to burn through) but it's just starting to get into the details of the subject.

The Author spends a bit of time establishing the motivation behind creating this work, and how it relates to their job and experiments they've tried before. They relate life experiences that kind of paint a picture of how they got to 'where they were' as an adult, and why they want to change things. While I can't relate to every aspect of their childhood, I can relate to trying to backfill the timeline that gives some explanation of where I am and why I feel the way I do/react to things in the world the way I do.

Looking forward to making more progress on this one once I burn through my holds on borrowed books.
