Another Hugh Howey book, I had a hold on this one for a while and when it came up, I burned through it pretty quickly. I also didn't know that a tv series was made from it.

It's an interesting story, a lighthouse keeper in space. Everything you think about manning a lifehouse, the loneliness and psychological effects of isolation play out here. It was good. I am almost hesitant to see what the show did with the premise (also apparently the show was abruptly canceled after two seasons)
