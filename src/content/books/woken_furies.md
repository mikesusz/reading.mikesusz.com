Finished book three of the Takeshi Kovacs trilogy. He was a little difficult to deal with in this one. A lot has happened since the end of the events in Broken Angels, and Kovacs had _a lot_ going on.

This was an interesting blend of revealing information about his younger life, his reaction to traumatic events, and how he channels this into a cause that he doesn't fully believe in, but also serves some of personal interests.

It was a satisfying end, or at least, a satisfying conclusion to this era. I think I'm going to need something a lot lighter for my next book.
